# Basic Concept

* What is CI/CD?

  CI pipeline runs when code changes and should make sure all of your changes work with the rest of the code when it is integrated. It should also compile your code, run tests and check it is functional. 

  CD pipeline deploys built code into production.





# Workflow

* Checkout, use pre-defined actions
